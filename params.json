Alchemide is fully extendible because of great job C9 did with ACE. You can add any language support,\r\nalthough ACE Editor supports a lot of them out of the box.\r\nYou can get basicly any language highlighed in Alchemide.\r\nAutocompletion works in naive mode by default, but You can add intelligent completion on the server side\r\nwith HTTP interface\r\n\r\n##### Is Alchemide production ready?\r\nNope. Alchemide project started 3 March 2015 and is considered to be in early stage development.\r\n\r\n##### Can I use Alchemide on my website?\r\nIf You'd like than of course You can. I'd appreciate a note with a link to this repository though\r\n\r\n##### How can I check what's already supported and what's not?\r\nI recommend taking a look at Alchemide's [official Trello page](https://trello.com/b/299ZIZkT/alchemide)\r\n\r\n##### Can I join Alchemide team?\r\nOf course. We're open source and we appreciate any help. Whoever You are - designer, coder, erlang/elixir passionate, a guy with great ideas - we appreciate any help of Yours.\r\n","google":"UA-56241713-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
